        <h1>Welcome to the proxy that will steal all of your personal information and kill you in the process.</h1>
        <p>Now, I must start with some clarification. First of all, this does not unblock anything nor let you play games. If that's why you're here, then stop reading! <br>
        Just kidding! Well this is a website made by a complete newby and my name is timmy, but I think I can get it done. I present you now the logo of my website:</p>
        <img src="Untitled.png" width="29%" height="29%">
        <div class="relative">
            <p style="margin:0px">The logo was created by me and is a combination of the Timberwolf of Tyee and the fist that normally sumbolizes justice..  
            When combined, you get a fist punching the Timberwolf. This shows that we don't care about the Timberwolf and we want justice too, hence the fist.
            My proxy will let anyone search freely and not be controlled by leaders that object! Now you also should read my awesome "Terms of Service"
            document that you shouldn't ignore:<br>
            <em>You are responsible for all of the information you give us of your personal life, your browsing history, your social security number,<br>
            and lastly information about your family. Something else you should note is I will remain anonymous so you won't know who to complain to after you lose everything.</em></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0px">Well now that we're done with all the serious stuff, I think it's only fair I show the awesome features of my proxy.</p>
